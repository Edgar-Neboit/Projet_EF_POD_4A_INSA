# Project Finite Element and model reduction

This repository include two project : 
  1. Projet in Finite Element implementation method in python
  2. Projet in model reduction including the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and hydrid POD-Neural Nerwork method for numerical simulation of PDE
This two project are written in python using tensorflow, fenics and others classicals python librairies.
